# Science-Museum
Brief Online: Science museum website
An interactive science museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

You have been provided media assets in the form of text and images (see link under Resources). It is for you to decide how these will be used, in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design.
